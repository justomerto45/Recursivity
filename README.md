# Recursivity

This repository contains a C# project demonstrating recursion techniques. It provides various examples and implementations of recursive algorithms.

## Project Description
The project illustrates how recursion can be utilized in C# to solve problems efficiently. It includes various recursive methods, such as:
- Analyzing the number of files and directories within a folder
- Calculating the total size of a directory
- Recursively visualizing the folder structure

The main class `FileSystemAnalyzer` recursively analyzes a directory and displays the results in the console.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: C#
- Framework: .NET
- Used Classes: `System.IO.Directory`, `System.IO.FileInfo`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justomerto45/Recursivity.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Modify the `path` variable to specify the directory you want to analyze.
4. Compile and run the application.

## Usage
- The program outputs the number of files and directories, as well as the total size of a directory.
- It also visualizes the folder structure in a tree-like format.
- To test the program, adjust the path in the code accordingly.
